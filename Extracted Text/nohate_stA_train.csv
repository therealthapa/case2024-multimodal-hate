With their colleges either shut or com- pletely destroyed by invading Russian forces, the students are pinning their hopes on the newly elected Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab and chief minister Bhagwant Mann to bail them out. Twenty-one-year-old Tanush- ree, who is a third-year student at Ternopil National Medical University, says, ""Even if the war ends, it will take the authorities a long time to rebuild the infra- structure in Ukraine. Until then, Students submitting memorandum, addressed to chief minister Bhagwant Mann, to deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma in Ludhiana. the Indian government should make some provision for us to continue our education here."" Before assuming power, chief minister Bhagwant Mann had urged the central government to safely evacuate students from LENCIAGA Ukraine and also stressed that provisions be made for students returning from the war-torn country to complete their remaining education in India. After winning the elections Mann had pledged to make HT PHOTO MBBS courses affordable in the state so that students don't have to go abroad. He had said if a small country like Ukraine can provide medical education at an affordable rate, why can't India. Yashasvi Govind Rao, 21, a fourth-year student at Ternopil National Medical University in Ukraine, says: ""We have submit- ted a memorandum to the dep- uty commissioner, along with AAP MLA Madan Lal Bagga, reminding chief minister Bhag- want Mann of his promise."" ""In India, government medi- cal colleges don't have enough seats and studying medicine at a private college costs around Rs 1 crore. In Ukraine, it costs less than half that amount, including the education fee, accommoda- tion, food, etc."" At least 250 students and their parents in Ludhiana have already sent their representation to the CM office, seeking help to save their future. The parents of students say they cannot risk sending their children back to Ukraine. Rajinder Singh, a school- teacher whose daughter is a fourth-year medical student at Sumy city of Ukraine, says it is impossible to return to Ukraine. ""After what my daughter had to go through, I cannot send her back to the war-torn country."""

KRAMER KYIV, Ukraine - They met in high school but became a couple years later, after meeting again on a dance floor at a Ukrainian night- club. Married in 2001, they lived in a bedroom community outside Kyiv, in an apartment with their two children and their dogs, Benz and Cake. She was an accountant and he was a computer program- mer. Serhiy and Tetiana Perebyinis owned a Chevrolet minivan. They shared a country home with friends, and Ms. Perebyinis was a dedicated gardener and an avid skier. She had just returned from a ski trip to Georgia. And then, late last month, Rus- sia invaded Ukraine, and the fight- ing quickly moved toward Kyiv. It wasn't long before artillery shells were crashing into their neighbor- hood. One night, a shell hit their building, prompting Ms. Perebyi- nis and the children to move to the basement. Finally, with her husband away in eastern Ukraine tending to his ailing mother, Ms. Perebyinis de- cided it was time to take her chil- dren and run. They didn't make it. Ms. Pere- byinis, 43, and her two children, PEREBYINIS FAMILY Serhiy and Tetiana Perebyinis renewed their vows in 2013.

Their luggage a blue roller suitcase, a gray suitcase and some backpacks - was scattered near their bodies, along with a green carrying case for a small dog that was barking. They were four people among the many who tried to cross that bridge last weekend, but their deaths resonated far beyond their Ukrainian suburb. A photograph Continued on Page A14"

Insects from hives left near the village of Chelburda (until 2016 - the Proletarian) woke up and flew into the territory of the military unit captured by Russian soldiers. There, due to lack of food, they bit the occupiers. ""The fact is that with the onset of heat beekeepers feed the bees, but now not everyone can do it. Hungry bees acted particularly aggressively, their attack cost three invaders.

Ukraine takes fight to Putin ● Zelensky's forces 'counter-attack' after Russian advance stalls Invaders have lost an estimated 7,000 troops and 230 tanks FADEL SENNA/AFP/GETTY IMAGES The Ukrainian side also says that it is now counter-attacking against stalled Russian positions as the invasion enters its fourth week. Moscow is having to summon troops from other deployments.. DIEU ET Friday March 18 2022 | thetimes.co.uk | No 73734 Russian forces were being held off last night both east and west of the capital, Kyiv, as well as in the second. city, Kharkiv, despite a ferocious bombardment. The besieged city of Mariupol was resisting the Russian. advance in the south, and the Ukrainian military said it was counter- attacking east of Mykolaiv and around Kherson, which is in Russian hands. In other developments yesterday: Britain said it would deploy its Sky Sabre missile defence system as well as 100 troops to Poland as part of measures to beef up security on Natos eastern flank. ● Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said Russian attacks on civilians constituted ""a war crime"" and that American officials had started to document allegations of atrocities. A Ukrainian official said that about 90 per cent of buildings in the port city of Mariupol had been damaged or destroyed as rescuers continued to search the rubble of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday. An elite Ukrainian drone unit said it had destroyed dozens of ""priority tar- gets by attacking Russians as they slept. A senior Russian security service official is thought to have been detained for leaking information about Ukraine, a sign that President Putin may be seek- ing scapegoats for his army's failure to achieve a rapid victory. An online monitor, Oryx Blog, which uses only open-source material to establish losses, said that 230 Russian tanks were confirmed destroyed, abandoned, captured or otherwise lost. An undercover Times reporter worked at the DVLA last month. Managers told of spending working days in bed watch- ing TV box sets. Staff said they were demoralised as colleagues on paid special leave who claimed to be too vulnerable to come to the office were ""not doing any work yet they are out That would represent the greatest loss of tanks by an army in conflict since the Second World War. It is also possibly an underestimate of total losses, put by the Ukrainian side at 400. ""It clearly is not going the way that Russia planned,"" one western official said. ""Not only is it not going the way that it was planned, but even as they have adjusted to a rather more grinding form of warfare, that is stalling as well. ""That is very encouraging resistance from the Ukrainians. We don't know how long they can hold out. We hope it .We hope it will be as long as possible. Backlogs have led to some people who rely on their cars for work being unable to drive for more than a year. Lorry drivers have been prevented ""We know that Russia is trying to generate more forces to sustain the campaign and we see signs out of some quite peripheral places around Russia and its borders, which clearly was not part of the original plan."" There have also been new estimates of Russian losses. The Pentagon said it believed that at least 7,000 Russian troops had been killed-well short of the Ukrainian estimate of almost 14,000 but still more than the United States lost in Afghanistan and Iraq put together since 2001. Russia has significantly not put out an official figure for military losses since admitting on March 2 that 498 soldiers had been killed.

IK 8428 Pro-Russian troops in the separatist-controlled settlement of Mykolaivka, Ukraine, on Tuesday. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters AT WASHINGTON - Plagued by poor morale as well as fuel and food shortages, some Russian troops in Ukraine have surrendered en masse or sabotaged their own vehicles to avoid fighting, a senior Pentagon official said on Tuesday. Some entire Russian units have laid down their arms without a fight after confronting surprisingly stiff Ukrainian defense, the official said. A significant number of the Russian troops are young conscripts who are poorly trained and ill-prepared for the all-out assault. And in some cases, Russian troops have deliberately punched holes in their vehicles' gas tanks, presumably to avoid combat, the official said. The Pentagon official declined to say how the military made these assessments - presumably a mosaic of intelligence including statements from captured Russian soldiers and communications intercepts - or how widespread these setbacks may be across the sprawling battlefield. But taken together, these factors may help explain why Russian forces, including an ominous 40-mile convoy of tanks and armored vehicles near Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, have come to a near crawl in the past day or two, U.S. officials said."

But this isn't the case in the south. Cloud seeding is a technique where you introduce small particles in the clouds, basically forcing clouds to start raining. This is something China usually uses before big events to prevent rain where the events take place. This is a technique Ukraine should start using in areas they know Russian troops are trying to advance. Feed the clouds with particles, make them rain like never before. Block the big roads. This not only forces the Russian troops to stay on the big roads or try desperately to find alternative routes, but it will even further make the Russian soldiers lose morale. It will be cold and wet, and they will want to keep engines running to have some kind of heat, which will lead to even more logistical difficulties because they have an even bigger need of fuel. This will also prevent Russian troops from driving out on fields to be able to shoot missiles at peaceful Ukrainian cities, because of all the mud. Imagine yourself being sent to Ukraine (as a Russian conscript), you know there may be enemy troops anywhere, you are wet, freezing like crazy, out of fuel, haven't eaten in 3 days, mud everywhere you go. Hope this reaches the right people in Ukraine, so it can be considered as an alternative defence mechanism. STAY STRONG"

On Saturday, international financial service providers Visa and Mastercard said they would suspend operations in Russia within the next several days due to the latest Western sanctions related to Moscow's ongoing war in Ukraine. The drastic step makes the use of cards issued in Russia outside the country implausible. Likewise, cards that were issued outside of Russia will stop working in Russia. Visa and Mastercard are the latest international brands taking harsh moves towards Russia over the Ukrainian conflict. Earlier, companies such as PayPal, Netflix, Intel, Inditex, Airbnb and R Royce announced they were leaving the country's market. +"

China's position on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states has been consistent. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be jointly upheld. At the same time, we note that the issue of Ukraine is rooted in a complex web of historical and present factors. An interplay of those factors has driven the situation to this point. In the current context, all parties concerned should exercise restraint, and avoid taking any action that may aggravate tensions. China calls on all parties to recognize the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, to continue to engage in dialogue and consultation, and to seek reasonable solutions that address each other's concerns through peaceful means on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

The base is a logistics hub and assembly centre for foreign volunteers travelling to join the fight for Ukraine. This attack serves two other purposes. First, it is a message to Nato to cease sending in weapons. It fits with Putin's nuclear threats, aimed to deter Nato leaders from direct military intervention in the conflict. The proximity to Poland underlines that warning. Putin already considers Nato's supply of weapons, as well as sanctions against Russia, as acts of war. Putin does not believe Nato will deploy troops or air power. However, it is possible he is trying to provoke some form of limited western engagement against Russia as a means of shoring up support at home.

Second, Putin knows that expanding the war westward, even if only from the air at the moment, will further terrorise the Ukrainian population. In line with his original strategy, he still hopes that intensifying fear will pressure its government to capitulate to his demands. President Zelensky's comments five days ago - that Ukraine is no longer pressing for NATO membership and that he is prepared to compromise on. the status of the two Donbas breakaway territories - will have encouraged him."

Russia has previously used similar tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016, employing both air and ground-based munitions. Russian supply lines reportedly continue to be targeted, slowing the rate of advance of their ground forces.

Biden has previously stressed that the US and Nato would not send sol- diers to Ukraine owing to fears of a di- rect military confrontation with Russia. British government sources have pri- vately voiced frustration at such re- marks, feeling a better approach would be to keep President Putin guessing. At a press conference after a summit of Nato leaders in Brussels, Biden said: ""We would respond. We would respond. if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use."" He went on to say a decision would be made at the time, adding that Putin had miscalculated on the West's response to the war. ""Putin was banking on Nato being split,"" he said. ""It was clear to me that he didn't think we could sustain this cohesion. Nato has never, never been more united. Putin is getting ex- actly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine."" In other developments: Boris Johnson is trying to persuade Nato allies to supply tanks to Ukraine. in a move that puts him at odds with President Macron of France. Nato has increased its deployment to 40,000 troops on the alliance's eastern flank, a tenfold rise on prewar levels. Biden called for Russia's expulsion from the G20, the forum for the leaders. of the world's top economies. The US agreed to take 100,000 dis- placed Ukrainians as European Union leaders clashed over the refugee crisis. British defence sources played down Biden's remarks, saying that any Nato P&O admits breach The chief executive of P&O Ferries admitted to MPs that the firm broke employment law. when it fired 800 crew without consultation but said that he would do it again.

Page 36 INSIDE TIMES2 response to a Russian chemical weapon attack would ""depend on the circum- stances"". A source said they could not see the West ""taking any action that might lead to pulling them into war"". During a three-hour Nato meeting. the 30 heads of state and government discussed steps to counter Russia's month-old invasion, including how to respond should Putin deploy chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary- general, said there were signs that Russia was preparing to use chemical or biological weapons. ""We are concerned because we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, US and Nato allies for prepar- ing to use chemical and biological weapons,"" he said. ""We have seen before that this way of accusing others is actually a way to try to get a pretext to do the same them- selves. Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict with wider consequences. This is a dangerous situation."" The Biden administration has avoid ed drawing red lines over the deploy- ment of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, conscious that in 2013 President Obama did not keep a pledge to act against Syria when it used chemi- cal weapons. Johnson refused to rule out direct military intervention in Ukraine in the event that Russia used such weapons. He said: ""I think that if Putin were to en- gage in anything like that, the conse- quences would be very, very severe. ""You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response. But when you look at what he's saying... I'm afraid when the Russians start doing stuff about factories in Ukraine producing American biological weaponry, you know that is a prelude to a false-flag op- eration. They could well do something."" A western official said: ""On the use of chemical weapons, we've all agreed [it] would be a fundamental change in the nature of the conflict that we would have to address.""

The average family faces a £1,100 hit in real incomes in 2022-23, rising to £3,200 for those in the top 10 per cent of working-age households, the biggest fall since the 1970s, the study estimates. That 10 per cent have about £56,000 a year in disposable income after housing costs. Torsten Bell, the foundation's direct- or, warned of ""huge income falls"" and said Sunak had not done enough in the face of a cost-of-living crisis that looks set to make this parliament the worst on record for household incomes"". Paul Johnson, director of the Insti- tute for Fiscal Studies, accused Sunak of being a ""fiscal illusionist"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government watchdog, said two thirds of the drop in real incomes was caused by inflation and the other third by higher taxes. Sunak told Sky News it was ""impossi- ble to fully protect people against"" rising inflation. However, the prime minister told LBC that the government would ""fix"" the cost-of-living problems. Stephen McPartland, the Tory MP for Stevenage, said ""I want to see more"" to help with energy costs. Peter Aldous, the Tory MP for Waveney, said some on low incomes were facing ""destitution"" as a result of Sunak's ""negligible"" help. One MP and ally of Sunak expressed frustration with such demands, telling The Times: ""Energy prices do go up and down, especially during a war. There's only so much you can and should do.""

Ivan Kuliak, 20, wore the symbol-which has effectively become the pro-Putin equivalent of the swastika in Nazi Germany on the podium at an event in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday. Speaking to RT, the gymnast said he'd repeat his actions and perversely claimed that the symbol represented Russia's desire for peace. ""If there was a second chance and I had a choice whether to go out with the letter 'Z' on my chest or not, I would do the same,"" he said. ""I saw it on our military and looked at what this symbol means. It turned out to be 'for victory' and 'for peace."" Kuliak wore the symbol in place of the banned Russian flag."

Rosoboronexport, said ma- nufacturing of the AK-203 ri- fles at the plant in Uttar Pra- desh was likely to begin within a few months and reach full-scale production. within two or three years. As part of pre-production activities, retrials were sche- duled to be done with am- munition from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in Russia in the first half of February, two de- fence sources independently said. But due to the current situation, they have been de- layed by at least three or four months, one of the sources said. While the production ac- tivities are on, manufactur- ing of rifles will start after the trials, it has been learnt. As reported by The Hindu earlier, with repeated delays in the deals for procurement Long in the tooth: AK-203 rifles will replace the INSAS rifles inducted over three decades ago. AKHILESH KUMAR of AK-203 assault rifles, India signed a deal last August for 70,000 AK-103 assault tickets to be procured off the shelf. The delivery of these rifles has been completed, officials said. In another small arms. deal, the repeat order for 72,400 SIG-716 assault rifles from Sig Sauer is delayed, and more than two officials, on condition of anonymity, said it is likely to be dropped. In December, Alexander Mikheev, Director-General of Over 6.1 lakh AK-203 as- sault rifles that cost over *5,000 crore will be manu- factured by a joint venture, Indo-Russian Rifles Private Ltd.

The rest of the rifles will be produced with 100% localisation. A modern pro- duction line has been esta- blished and a small arms range set up where both fac- tory and acceptance tests of assault rifles will be carried out. Under a 700-crore deal in February 2019 with Sig Sauer of the U.S., the De- fence Ministry procured 72,400 SIG-716 assault rifles through fast-track procure- ment, most of which were for the Army and have been provided to frontline troops involved in counter-insur- gency operations. The deal is in the Request For Proposal stage and went for approval from the com- petent financial authority in February, one of the sources cited above said.

Russia, suffering from demographic collapse and lack of innovation and entrepreneurial vigor, offers little to the CCP any more than easily accessible oil, natural gas, some metal and grain. Meanwhile, the CCP's economy is deeply dependent on Western democracies. On the one hand, the US and European capital markets are an important source of financing for the CCP' s increasingly debt-ridden economy, and on the other hand, the CCP relies on these democracies for the sale of its products. In short, the US can ally with Europe, reduce its dependence on China and Russia, and cement the reinvigoration of the U.S.-EU economic system. The CCP will gain very little economically from the entente with Russia if it continues, but it will lose much from the Western sanctions. Currently, the CCP s domestic conomy is under strong threat from a serious internal real estate crisis and external economic decoupling and technological decoupling. If it keeps supporting Russia, it will surely be beaten more heavily by the West, making economic recovery even harder. Xi Jinping' s support for Vladimir Putin' s aggression would therefore seriously weaken the near- and long-term economic prospects of Communist China, which will in turn have adverse domestic political consequences for Xi' s life-long rule.
