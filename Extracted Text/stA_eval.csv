The price of Brent crude, an international benchmark, reached a seven-year high of $97.76 (£72) a barrel on Tuesday. Russia ordered troops into two rebel-held regions in Ukraine's east after it recognised them as independent states. Asian stock markets closed lower, and US and European stock exchanges were braced for losses. The UK and several western allies have threatened sanctions on Russia, which is the second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. Russia is also the world's top producer of natural gas.

Youssef A Ukrainian military vehicle moving through Lviv after Sunday's attack on a military training facility. BRYAN SMITH/ZUMA PRESS Russia fired more than two dozen cruise missiles from long-range bombers flying over its own airspace during its Sunday attack on a Ukrainian military training center near the Polish border, a senior U.S. defense official said Monday. The U.S. assessment that the cruise missiles came from Russian airspace differs from initial reports from Ukrainian officials, who said Sunday the rockets were launched from a bomber over the Black Sea, where Russia has a bevy of warships. ""We assess that this was an air-launch cruise missile strike and only an air-launch cruise missile strike using more than a couple dozen cruise missiles,"" the U.S. defense official said. Ukrainian antiaircraft missile batteries destroyed most of the rockets, but eight reached their target at the Yavoriv military base, Ukraine's military said. The U.S. defense official said that the strikes damaged at least seven structures at Yavoriv. The airstrike killed at least 35 people at the facility in Yavoriv about 10 miles from the Polish border and raised fears that the war in Ukraine was inching closer to members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The strike also occurred near one of the main land routes European allies and the U.S. have used to deliver weapons to Ukraine, adding to concerns that Russia may be planning to attack those transport routes and the convoys using them. Last week, Moscow warned the West that it would consider arms deliveries to Ukraine as legitimate targets."

Putin's invasion of Ukraine has exposed Europe's huge dependence on Russian gas imports, and the Biden administration has promised its allies it will help break end this dependency. Net Zero Watch director Dr Benny Peiser said: 56 It's an utter travesty that officials in the Biden administration are able to block desperately needed energy support for European partners struggling to fight off Putin's energy war."

The Russian invasion of Ukraine came amidst heightened tensions between Moscow and NATO countries, with the former concerned about their precarious security apparatus as the latter mulled over its expansion in eastern Europe. Even as NATO and the US mount a propaganda blitz to counter Russia's invasion, they have turned a blind eye to a festering problem that seemed to have played a pivotal role in Putin's calculus to wage an armed conflict in Ukraine. And that is Ukraine's lingering ""Nazi"" problem. Over the years, neo-Nazism ideology has not only taken root in the Ukrainian conscience but has also gained the Ukrainian"

In G2 Daniel Boffey Lviv Vladimir Putin is to Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, the invaded country's military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the pros- pect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, Gen Kyrylo Budanov, who foretold Russia's invasion as far back as November, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare. The grim prediction came as Leo- nid Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine, said he would probably hold a referendum on his territory becoming part of Russia. ""I think that in the near future a referendum will be held on the terri- tory of the republic, during which the people will ... express their opinion on joining the Russian Federation,"" Pasechnik said. Budanov said he believed Putin had rethought his plan for full occupation since failing to swiftly take Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and overthrow Volody- myr Zelenskiy's government. ""It is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" he said of the new Kremlin strategy. News provider of the year Putin wants to split Ukraine in two like Korea, warns Kyiv Officials in Kyiv said they expected troops attacking the capital and th the embattled city of Kharkiv to move east within two weeks.

Provisions in the white paper would allow local authorities to establish Mats and gain powers to encourage schools to join one, ""where that is the right approach for local schools"", in areas lacking high- performing Mats. For 200 years Councils may also get significant new powers to force academies to accept children who are without a school place.

Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP Canada is boosting its military presence at Russia's border and sanctioning Russian sovereign debt, parliamentarians and companies, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday, citing what he said was an ""invasion"" of Ukraine. Up to 460 members of the Canadian Armed Forces will head to the Baltic country of Latvia, which shares a border with Russia, to join the 540 Canadian troops already stationed there. A frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy is also headed to the area, accompanied by one or more CP-140 Aurora spy planes, Ottawa has announced. Trudeau's government has banned Canadians from buying Russian sovereign debt and having any financial dealings with Donetsk or Lugansk, which Ottawa sees as part of Ukraine. Canada has also blacklisted Russian parliamentarians who voted in favor of recognizing the two Donbass republics as independent, as well as Russian banks,"
